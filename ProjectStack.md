## Tech Stack Overview

This project is built using modern web technologies aimed at creating a scalable, maintainable, and efficient application. The key technologies used are React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and various state management and validation libraries.

---

## Technology Details

### React

- **Description**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- **Purpose**: Allows for the creation of reusable components that manage their own state.

### TypeScript

- **Description**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
- **Purpose**: Improves code quality and maintainability by catching type-related errors during development.

### Vite

- **Description**: A fast development build tool that provides a better development experience compared to traditional bundlers.
- **Purpose**: Accelerates the build process and hot module replacement, leading to faster development cycles.

### Tailwind CSS

- **Description**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling applications.
- **Purpose**: Provides pre-defined classes to build custom designs without writing traditional CSS.

### ShadCN

- **Description**: A component library designed for building modern UIs.
- **Purpose**: Offers a set of pre-designed components that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

### Zustand

- **Description**: A small, fast state management library for React.
- **Purpose**: Manages global state in a simple and performant way, allowing components to share state easily.

### React Hook Form

- **Description**: A library for managing form state and validation in React.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies form handling by providing hooks for form validation and submission.

### Zod

- **Description**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- **Purpose**: Provides runtime validation and type inference for data structures, ensuring data integrity across the application.

### React Query

- **Description**: A library for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React applications.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies data fetching and state management for server-side data.
